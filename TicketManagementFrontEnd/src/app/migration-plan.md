# Migration Plan: Consolidating Client and User Components

This document outlines the steps taken to consolidate duplicate backoffices for users (originally split between `client` and `users` directories).

## Changes Made

1. **Routing Updates**:
   - Modified `app.routes.ts` to redirect `/client` to `/user`
   - Updated `roles.ts` to make `CLIENT` role use the same route as `USER` role
   - Updated `users.routes.ts` to allow both `USER` and `CLIENT` roles access

2. **New Components**:
   - Added `UserReportsComponent` to incorporate functionality from the client reports

3. **User Interface**:
   - Updated the user navbar to include a link to the reports component

## Files to Delete

The following files/directories are now redundant and can be safely deleted:

```
TicketManagementFrontEnd/src/app/pages/client/
```

This includes:
- client.routes.ts
- client-layout.component.ts
- client-dashboard/
- client-profile/
- client-reports/
- client-tickets/

## Testing

After implementing these changes, please test the following:

1. Log in as a USER role and verify you can access:
   - Dashboard
   - Tickets
   - Reports
   - Profile

2. Log in as a CLIENT role and verify you can access the same components

3. Verify that clicking on the profile icon in the navbar redirects to the profile page

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the original client components are preserved in the codebase and can be restored by updating the routing back to their original configuration.
